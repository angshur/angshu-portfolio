Most attribution debates start **too late**.

If the “inputs” (UTM parameters) are chaotic, every downstream layer becomes a patchwork:
- dashboards need constant manual cleanup
- filters are inconsistent
- naming conventions drift across teams

### A practical rule
If you can’t answer “what does this campaign name mean?” in 3 seconds, you’ll pay for it for months.

### What I recommend
1. A naming spec with examples
2. A lightweight UTM builder (so humans don’t freestyle)
3. A validation step before launch
