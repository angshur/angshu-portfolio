## Context
Customers want to build advanced metrics, but the UI and syntax are a barrier.

## Hypothesis
If we let users describe calculations in plain English and build guardrails, we cut setup time and unblock adoption.

## Approach
- Structured prompt spec (inputs, schema, constraints)
- Validation loop: parse → compile → suggest fixes
- UX that encourages iterative refinement

## Result
- (Add 3–6 outcomes)

## What I learned
When you combine **clear data context** and **strict output format**, users trust AI faster.
