## What they launched
Measured introduced a budget optimization product that allocates omnichannel spend to business outcomes.

## The product move
This is strategic because it turns MMM from a “quarterly report” into a decision engine.

## What I like
- clear persona: enterprise marketers with complex budgets
- outcome-first framing (not channel-first)

## Where I'd push further
- make the “why” behind each recommendation explorable
- workflows: one-click scenario planning + approvals
