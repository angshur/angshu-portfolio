Domo has breadth: ingestion, modeling, viz, apps.

That’s also the challenge: who is it *for* today?

## Notes
- The app ecosystem is a strength if it’s tied to a clear persona and repeatable use cases.
- “Time to value” needs opinionated templates.

## What I’d borrow
- App store thinking for packaged vertical solutions.
