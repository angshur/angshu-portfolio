## What it is
Talk to Data lets users ask questions in natural language and get answers grounded in their governed datasets, metric definitions, and current dashboard context.

## Scope I owned
- UX for asking, refining, and trusting answers
- Guardrails and governance (permissions, definitions, explainability)
- Integration into existing dashboards and reporting workflows

## Wins
- Reduced dependency on analysts for common exec and AM questions.
- Made complex datasets more accessible to broader teams.

## How I measure success
- Questions answered per week
- Follow-up rate (signals users are exploring, not abandoning)
- Trust signals: citations, “show your work,” and low dispute rates
