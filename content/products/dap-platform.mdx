## What it is
DAP is the shared platform substrate that makes the suite coherent: consistent metadata, permissions, tenant isolation, and reusable services across ETL, analytics, reporting, and AI.

## Scope I owned
- Metadata strategy (naming, metric definitions, mapping rules)
- Permissions and governance patterns across products
- Cross-product workflows that depend on shared services

## Wins
- Enabled cross-product workflows with consistent governance at scale.
- Improved enterprise readiness for large agencies and media groups (permissions, consistency, operational control).

## How I measure success
- Multi-product adoption per account
- Reduction in “same concept, different definition” incidents
- Time-to-onboard for enterprise accounts

## What I’d push next
Turn platform capabilities into explicit “building blocks” customers understand — not hidden plumbing — so adoption becomes intentional.
