## What it is
SmartSuite is the bundled “value layer” that sits on top of core reporting + data: benchmarks, goals, AI insights, and a unified surface for cross-product adoption.

## Scope I owned
- Packaging strategy and positioning (what belongs in the bundle, why it matters)
- Adoption loops (where insights show up, how users get to “aha”)
- Cross-product attach surfaces across reporting, ETL, and AI workflows

## Wins
- Repositioned analytics + insights into a packaged suite customers could understand and buy.
- Became the primary attach motion across reporting, ETL, and AI offerings — enabling expansion conversations.

## How I measure success
- Attach rate to existing accounts
- Expansion ARR influenced
- Multi-product adoption per account

## What I’d push next
Make “insight → action → confirmation” the default path, so SmartSuite isn’t only awareness — it reliably drives measurable outcomes.
