## What it is
SmartAnalytics is the analytics layer built for marketing teams — fast dashboards and drilldowns that don’t require a BI expert to operate.

## Scope I owned
- Dashboard and widget UX (build, share, drilldown)
- Filtering + governance patterns (so data stays consistent across teams)
- Benchmarks + goals integration into day-to-day performance reviews

## Wins
- Enabled unified exec-level performance views across fragmented channels.
- Supported benchmark and goal-based tracking so teams could judge “good vs bad” quickly.

## How I measure success
- Weekly active dashboard users
- Time-to-first-insight for new accounts
- Share/export actions per account (signals dashboards are actually used)

## What I’d push next
Tighter loops from insight → recommended action → execution, so dashboards become operational, not just observational.
