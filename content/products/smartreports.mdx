## What it is
SmartReports is how agencies and media companies build and schedule client-ready reporting at scale — across many accounts, audiences, and permission models.

## Scope I owned
- Report builder UX and template strategy
- Scheduling + delivery reliability
- RBAC and multi-client workflows for agency ops teams

## Wins
- Improved report creation speed and reliability for ops teams that manage reporting at scale.
- Strengthened scheduled delivery for external stakeholders (consistent cadence, fewer failures).

## How I measure success
- Weekly active scheduled reports
- Delivery success rate (on-time, correct recipients)
- Adoption of templates vs one-off reports

## What I’d push next
More guided “report → narrative → slides” flows, so AMs and strategists spend less time formatting and more time advising.
