## What it is
A repeatable evaluation system to ensure agent outputs are accurate, relevant, consistent, and safe — before and after release.

## Scope I owned
- Scorecard design (what we test, what “pass” means)
- Golden tasks and regression suites for high-risk workflows
- Feedback loops from production to improve prompts and tools

## Wins
- Established structured evals and golden-task testing for agent outputs.
- Improved confidence in enterprise rollout by reducing low-quality outputs.

## How I measure success
- Eval pass rate by agent type
- Reduction in low-quality or unsafe outputs over time
- Time-to-iterate safely (speed without breaking trust)
