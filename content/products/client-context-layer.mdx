## What it is
A backend context system that supplies AI agents with the right “truth” for each client: industry, benchmarks, goals, data coverage, schema, and governance rules.

## Scope I owned
- Context schema (what’s included, what’s authoritative)
- Retrieval + assembly patterns (fast, consistent, permission-aware)
- Product integration so agents rely on platform context, not brittle prompts

## Wins
- Improved relevance and personalization of AI outputs across clients.
- Reduced prompt brittleness by shifting grounding into platform services.

## How I measure success
- Contextualized AI responses per week
- Output satisfaction rate (and fewer “that doesn’t match our data” complaints)
- Reduction in prompt complexity for new agent types
