## What it is
Insight Agents produce trustworthy, repeatable insights directly from a user’s current dashboard context — including filters, metric definitions, and time windows.

## Scope I owned
- Agent design patterns (inputs, outputs, constraints, explainability)
- Grounding strategy (dashboards, widgets, schema, client rules)
- Rollout plan for dozens of agent types without losing quality

## Wins
- Put AI insights “in the flow of work” on live dashboards (not in a disconnected chat).
- Established reusable patterns that scaled across many insight categories.

## How I measure success
- Weekly active agent runs
- Repeat usage per account (insights that stick)
- Output satisfaction / feedback signal quality

## What I’d push next
Pair insight agents with operator agents to close the loop: insight → recommended action → execution → observed impact.
