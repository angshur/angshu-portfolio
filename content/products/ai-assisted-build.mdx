## What it is
AI-assisted build flows help users create dashboards, widgets, calculations, and reports quickly — with guardrails that match their data reality.

## Scope I owned
- Guided build flows (what to ask, when to suggest, when to validate)
- Safe defaults and templates based on common agency workflows
- Integration with governance and metadata so builds stay consistent

## Wins
- Reduced time-to-first usable dashboard for new users.
- Improved self-serve onboarding success by lowering configuration friction.

## How I measure success
- Time to first usable dashboard
- Completion rate of onboarding build flows
- Reduction in support tickets for “how do I build X?”
