## What it is
TapETL is the ingestion + transformation foundation for the TapClicks stack — connectors, normalization, QA, and governed exports into reporting, BI, and AI.

## Scope I owned
- Connector strategy (top platforms + long-tail coverage)
- Data normalization model + metadata layer
- Reliability: pipelines, retries, monitoring, customer-facing transparency
- Downstream integration into dashboards, reporting, and AI grounding

## Wins
- Expanded scalable data coverage across hundreds of marketing sources.
- Improved data reliability and trust, enabling analytics and AI layers to work on clean, consistent data.

## How I measure success
- Successful daily pipeline runs (%)
- Data freshness SLA adherence
- Reduction in customer-reported data issues over time

## What I’d push next
Make data quality more visible and self-serve (what’s wrong, why, and how to fix) so support load decreases as scale increases.
