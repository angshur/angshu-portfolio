## What it is
SmartStory turns dashboard data into clear, executive-ready narratives — what happened, why it happened, and what to do next.

## Scope I owned
- Narrative structure and quality bar (what “good” looks like)
- Grounding rules so insights match dashboard filters and customer schema
- UX patterns for review, edits, and export to stakeholder formats

## Wins
- Reduced manual analysis and slide prep for AMs and strategists.
- Improved EBR/QBR storytelling quality and consistency across accounts.

## How I measure success
- Stories generated per week
- Repeat usage per account (not just one-time novelty)
- Time saved for AMs/strategists vs manual writeups

## What I’d push next
Make narratives “actionable by default” by pairing each story with a suggested next step and a one-click path to execute.
